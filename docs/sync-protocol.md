SYNC-PROTOCOL.md — Formal chat synchronization protocol
- Required timezone: Tashkent (UTC+05:00).
- At the end of a chat: create a new validated STATUS.yaml version and save it.
- In a new chat: I provide DESCRIPTION.md, ROADMAP.md, RULES.md, STATUS.yaml — you confirm the position and continue strictly from the current stage.
